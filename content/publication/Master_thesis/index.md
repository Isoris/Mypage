abstract: "Aquaculture has made significant strides in providing a sustainable and efficient protein source. However, bacterial infections such as those caused by *Streptococcus agalactiae* and *Aeromonas veronii* remain a persistent challenge, affecting the health and productivity of Nile tilapia (*Oreochromis niloticus*) fingerlings. This study aimed to assess and compare the efficacy of two bivalent inactivated vaccines administered through different methods: oral vaccine followed by an oral booster (OR+OR) and immersion vaccine followed by an oral booster (IM+OR).  

Two cohorts of Nile tilapia fingerlings (1.1 +- 0.1 g) were randomly assigned to two tanks (150 fish/tank). In the OR+OR group, fish were immunized with an oral vaccine on days 1-7, followed by a daily oral booster on days 21-28. In contrast, the IM+OR group received an immersion vaccine on day 1, supplemented with a daily oral booster on days 21-28.  

Key measurements included IgM antibody levels against both *Streptococcus agalactiae* and *Aeromonas veronii*, as well as survival rates post-artificial infection. The findings shed light on the vaccine's capacity to stimulate IgM responses and confer protective immunity against these bacterial pathogens. I found that for those formulations specifically, immersion was more effective in conferring protective efficacy for a few months and that oral vaccines were more appropriate to be given as a booster after primer vaccination. The outcomes from this study offer valuable insights into optimal vaccination strategies for enhancing aquatic animal health in aquaculture, specifically for Nile tilapia."
