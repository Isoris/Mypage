abstract: In the important aquaculture farmed species (fishes, molluscs, crustaceans), controlling reproduction is important because of the negative effect of the sexual maturation on the growth of the animals, the survival, but also its organoleptic features. To overcome the downsides of the sexual maturation, sterility can be induced via polyploiditism such as auto-triploidization and allotriploidization from tetraploids. Moreover a triploid stage can bring beneficial advantages over diploid fishes. This paper aims to review basic principles in ploidy manipulation for aquaculture, with emphasis on Salmonids, Sturgeons, and Groupers.

summary: In the 1980s, aquaculture-oriented studies began to improve performances of farmed strains by chromosome manipulation techniques in various species of fin-fishes and aquatic invertebrates. A small review explores the use of the ploidy manipulation techniques in aquaculture for some important species of fish but not for crustaceans or molluscs.
