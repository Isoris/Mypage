  ## 🛠️ Technical Summary
  My daily work involved genome assembly, bacterial annotation, variant detection, and downstream analyses for diagnostic, evolutionary, and vaccine development purposes. This included coding in R, Bash, and Python; managing high-throughput sequencing datasets; performing quality control; and mapping reads against custom reference panels. I worked hands-on with protein purification techniques, developed low-cost vaccine prototypes, and coordinated multiple comparative genomics workflows to bridge aquaculture research with human health insights.
