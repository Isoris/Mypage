Found that for those formulations specifically, immersion was more effective in conferring protective efficacy for a few months and that oral vaccines were more appropriate to be given as a booster after primer vaccination.
    - Designed DNA vaccine constructs for Golden Gate Assembly Level 1/2 Cloning based on pangenome comparisons.
    - mRNA vaccines: Explored mRNA vaccine design and manufacturing against TiLV for Nile tilapia (Project stalled)

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Summary
  My daily work involved genome assembly, bacterial annotation, variant detection, and downstream analyses for diagnostic, evolutionary, and vaccine development purposes. This included coding in R, Bash, and Python; managing high-throughput sequencing datasets; performing quality control; and mapping reads against custom reference panels. I worked hands-on with protein purification techniques, developed low-cost vaccine prototypes, and coordinated multiple comparative genomics workflows to bridge aquaculture research with human health insights.
