I am looking for a PhD position in the field of aquaculture. I would like to make my own research contribution towards aquaculture genomics. I currently live in Thailand where I am doing my master thesis at Asian Institute Of Technology. My research project's objective will be to study the *Systemic and mucosal immune response of Nile tilapia to monovalent and bivalent vaccines against bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas veronii* (June 2021 - May 2022)
