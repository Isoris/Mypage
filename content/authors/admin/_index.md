I am looking for a PhD position in the field of aquaculture. I would like to make my own research contribution towards aquaculture genomics. I am currently in Thailand working on my master thesis. My research project's objective is to develop a *Proof of Concept of an in vitro transcribed mRNA vaccine against Carp Edema Virus Disease using a low-cost experimental design* (June 2021 - May 2022)
