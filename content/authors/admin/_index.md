Genomics and bioinformatics researcher specializing in complex genome assembly and analysis. My work focuses on developing computational approaches for resolving challenging genomes, particularly in aquaculture species and their pathogens.

I've successfully assembled haplotype-resolved genomes of commercially important fish species and analyzed microbial genomes for aquaculture health management. My research contributes to sustainable aquaculture practices, genetic improvement programs, and pathogen surveillance.

With expertise spanning molecular biology, computational genomics, and aquaculture science, I bring an interdisciplinary approach to genomic research with practical applications in food security and aquatic resource management.
