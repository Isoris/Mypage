### Introduction

👋 Hello! I'm Quentin Andres 👨‍💻, a second-year PhD candidate in Fisheries Science and Technology at Kasetsart University.

👉 My research focuses on the intersection of aquatic animal health, molecular biology, and genomics. Specifically, I aim to develop sustainable and low-cost vaccines 💉 for aquaculture, with a current focus on *Streptococcus iniae* 🦠 affecting Asian seabass 🐟. The methodologies I employ have potential applicability to a wider range of aquatic vertebrates and bacterial pathogens.

#### 🎓 Educational Background

-   **Doctoral Program**: Fisheries Science and Technology, Kasetsart University (Ongoing)
-   **MSc**: Aquaculture and Aquatic Resources Management, Asian Institute of Technology
-   **BSc**: Life Sciences with a major in Molecular and Genetic Biology (BMG), University Côte d'Azur
-   **Baccalauréat**: Major in Life Sciences and Physics, Lycée Jacques Audiberti

#### 🔬 **Research Focus**

1.  Development of Recombinant and Plasmid DNA Vaccines for *Streptococcus iniae*
2.  Utilization of Quality by Design (QbD) to Streamline Aquaculture Vaccine Manufacturing
3.  Multifaceted Approaches in Bacterial Epidemiology, Pan-genomics, and Reverse Vaccinology

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📚 Current Research

My thesis is organized into multiple facets, including:

-   🧬 Low-cost vaccine manufacturing for aquaculture (recombinant platform)
-   🧬 Low-cost vaccine manufacturing for aquaculture (pDNA platform)
-   💻 Comparative genomics of *Streptococcus iniae*
-   🧪 Reverse vaccinology coupled with bacterial pan-genomics
-   🌡  Vaccine design, purification, and efficacy evaluation

🔎 The initial phase of my research was conducted under the Laboratory of Aquatic Animal Health Management and the Center of Excellence in Aquatic Animal Health Management, both housed within the Faculty of Fisheries at Kasetsart University.

📝 My first research article,"Comparative Genomics and Reverse Vaccinology of Streptococcus iniae: Blueprints for Affordable Aquaculture Vaccines," introduces a novel framework for more affordable vaccines by integrating epidemiology, pan-genomics, and reverse vaccinology, coupled with Quality By Design (QbD) principles and will soon be published..

### 📝 Recent Student Research and Practical Experiences

#### Whole Genome Assembly

-   **New Generation Sequencing**: Performed whole genome assembly of *Streptococcus iniae* isolates from diseased-farmed Asian seabass fish.
-   **Technologies**: Illumina PE short-reads and long sequencing reads (PacBio or Nanopore).
-   **Methodologies**: Single reference mapping, de-novo assembly, reference-guided de-novo assembly, multiple reference mapping directly onto pangenome graphs.
-   **Submissions to public health databases**: Submitted my results to NCBI under the bioproject number *PRJNA933632* (Currently private, five Biosamples with short sequencing reads and GenBank assemblies will soon be released..).

#### Aquatic Animal Vaccines

-   **Inactivated vaccines**: Developed and evaluted oral-oil-encapsulated and immersion monovalent and bivalent vaccines for *Streptococcus agalactiae* and *Aeromonas veronii* for Nile tilapia. Found that for those formulations specifically, immersion was more effective in conferring protective efficacy for a few months and that oral vaccines were more appropriate to be given as a booster after primer vaccination.

-   **mRNA vaccines**: Explored mRNA vaccine design and manufacturing against TiLV for Nile tilapia (Project stalled)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📝 Older Student Research and Practical Experiences

-   **Transfection Efficacy**: Evaluated using Effectene transfection reagent on S2R+ cells, incorporating both an empty vector and a GFP-containing expression vector.
-   **Induction of Apoptosis and Necrosis**: Facilitated by the addition of staurosporine to the cell culture medium; optimized the concentration range for apoptosis induction.
-   **Imaging Techniques**: Utilized confocal microscopy with propidium iodide tagging in S2R+ cells to study apoptosis signaling pathways-mitochondrial pathway post-staurosporine treatment.

#### Cardiovascular physiology

-   **Research Objective**: Investigated the regulatory mechanisms of blood vessel diameter, as part of a team.
-   **Model Used**: Isolated ring of aorta from a rat.
